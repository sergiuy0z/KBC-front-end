                    Firstly, we are an independent family run brewery & gastropub which has allowed us to create Kildare's 1st Ever Brewpub. We are 2nd Generation Publican's which has allowed us to become 1st Generation Brewery owners, which we are very grateful for from past generations.
                    Secondly, all of us here at Kildare Brewing Company & Lock 13 are passionate about what we put on our plates & pour into our glasses, so when the idea was discussed to undertake a brewery project, there was an overwhelming yes as we would be in control of what went into your glass, unfiltered, unpasturised & no compromised fresh beer which is brewed 5 metres away.
                    At Kildare Brewing Company, we have created Kildare's 1st ever Brewpub & we are very proud of what we achieved to date. It has taken us 2 years from idea to completing this project, which has at times been strenuous on all parties involved. Today, we have a world class facility which when visiting Lock 13 Gastropub you can see through the glass wall (bullet proof glass, don't ask) & drink the freshest beer that is produced in Ireland today.. Why not come see our bespoke brewhouse & have a beer with us at <a href="#">Lock 13</a> or maybe book a <a href="#">brewery tour</a> which we can tell you everything you ever needed to know about our brewhouse up close & personal..

                <p id="para1" class="card_para">
                    2017 A Year we shall never forget…
                    February– our micro brewery equipment arrives on 40ft & 20ft containers from Dublin Port @ 5am on a blustery & cold morning. As we open the doors of the containers, we know that we are one step closer to creating the best beer that anyone has ever tasted. Little did we know the work ahead of us was going to be long, hard & at times testing to all parties involved in the demolition of the retail units into a modern bespoke brewhouse which you can see in front of you today when visiting us at Kildare Brewing Company..

                    March– With the brewery equipment onsite, Brendan our Master Brewer gets to work in connecting all the pipework & placing the tanks in the exact position that was agreed through CAD drawing with the engineers. Electricians, builders, painters & plumbers are all on site trying to get our little brew house firing on all cylinders before the July launch date.

                    April & May– Brewhouse installation is completed at the start of April & we are ready to brew in anger ahead of schedule, one little blip, there is still the building regulations, revenue commissioner sign off to complete & local council inspections. Is this ever going to happen we exclaimed.. We are looking at a finished brewery ready to go but only we get sign off from the relevant bodies all we can do is look & not touch..

                    July– Our brewery gets its clearance from all departments & we are ready to launch.. We launch on the 16th July, James Lawless TD & Joe Flanagan (Barry’s Father) cut the ribbon on Kildare Brewing Co & the tanks are fired up to brew fresh local premium beer

                    We let our beer condition naturally. All our beers are unfiltered, unpasteurized & without compromise. Our Helles Lager is no different & it takes 5-6 weeks from the time we brew to tapping at our beer tower for us to release it, allowing everything that was intended to be tasted left in the beer & NOTHING stripped out.

                    A <b>Traditional Irish Red Ale</b> which we are very proud of here in Kildare Brewing Company. This takes 10-14 days from the day it’s brewed to be ready on our beer tower & ferments very happy at 19 degrees. With it’s lower ABV of 3.8%, you might be fooled into thinking that it lacks flavour and body, but you would be very wrong. Our Master Brewer has packed 7 different malts into the mash tun to create a beer that is full on flavour but not too overpowering that you won’t want to buy another one, two or even three…

                    Typical fresh, malty & 5 hopped pale ale. We have created a fruity pale ale which will cater for both the craft beer lovers & also be approachable to the mainstream beer drinker who is looking for something easy to drink but still full of flavour. Our House Pale Ale is similar to an American Style Pale Ale with stone fruit aromas married together with a light but complex malt profile. There is a light & pleasant spicy notes which are completed by the presence of some tropical & pineapple characteristics.

                     was countered up one evening out of curiosity by our Master Brewer, Brendan Murphy. He wanted to trial our new 300 litre fermentation tanks which would allow us to ferment at room temperatures (18-22 degrees) without the need for external cooling/heating jackets. After 10 days we got a wonderful fresh German Style Weiss which was packed with Banana, Spice & Cloves which when tapped onto our Beer Tower in Lock 13 Gastropub, sold out in one week. Ever since we have brewed this beer with great applaud from our locals & German tourists alike, so we have given into our customers & added this to our core range, which we have brewed several batches off already since opening in July 2017. Every Brewpub should have a Weiss, as it needs to be drank fresh, which we can guarantee…
